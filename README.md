# Settle FastAPI Extensions

A collection of utilities meant to improve coding experience with FastAPI.

Disclaimer: this is an extract of Settle internal FastAPI utilities which Settle decide to
open-source back in 2021, but lacked the resources to make it truly stand on its own.
Use only if you're willing to take time to understand the code.
The original plan was and still is to add docs, make it a library, add scripts using py-invoke,
make a cookiecutter for the instrumentation part, add full test coverage, and more.
